# DATA TYPE AND ARRAY IN JAVA

#### Theory:-
---

Data type specifies the size and type of values that can be stored in an identifier. There are two types of data types in Java, they are:-
1. Primitive data type:-This includes
	* boolean
	* byte
	* char
	* short 
	* int
	* long 
	* float
	* double
2. Non-Primitive data type:-This includes
	* classes
	* Interfaces
	* Arrays

##### Arrays

Java provides a data structure, the array , which stores a fixed-sized sequential collections of elements of the same type. An is used to used store collection of data, but it is often also defined as collection if variables the same type.

Example:-
```Java
int a[]=new int[6];//declaration of single dimensional array
int b[][]=new int [3][3];//deckaration of two-dimensional(multi-dimensional array)

```
Output of [OneDimensionalArray.java](OneDimensionalArray.java) is

```
The numbers in array are:
3
4
5
6
```

Output of [TwoDimensionalArray.java](TwoDimensionalArray.java) is
```
The numbers in array are:
4
5
4
9
```
